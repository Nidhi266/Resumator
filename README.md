# Resumator
Resumator is a project I developed to automate the resume creation process and provide users with valuable feedback through both human and chatbot interfaces. It aims to simplify the task of resume generation by offering a user-friendly interface and interactive feedback.

Key Features:

Automated Resume Generation: Resumator streamlines the resume creation process by automating the formatting and layout tasks.

Human and Chatbot Feedback: Resumator provides users with comprehensive feedback on their resumes through both human reviewers and a chatbot interface. Human reviewers offer personalized insights and suggestions for improvement, while the chatbot provides real-time feedback on content, formatting, and overall effectiveness.
